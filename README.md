## About The Dataset

### Download URL

The input tsv files were obtained from [this repository](https://github.com/paul-shannon/bio-gdb/tree/main/forSam/v1). The tsv files were generated by extracting data from [Human-Gem.xml](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Human-GEM/blob/master/model/Human-GEM.xml) file in this [Human-GEM repository](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Human-GEM). An interactive web portal for viewing Human1 can be found [here](https://metabolicatlas.org/)
